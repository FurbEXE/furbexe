Furbexe 🐾

Furbexe is a desktop application that lets you connect to and control your Furby Connect over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

It provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for scanning, connecting, sending motor commands, playing presets, running custom sequences, and even inspecting the raw Bluetooth packets your Furby sends and receives.

🔗 One-Click Connect / Reconnect – Simple connection process.

🎚 Motor Control Sliders – Move ears, eyelids, mouth, feet, and body.

⚡ Presets – Built-in actions like Blink and Open Mouth.

🎭 Custom Sequences – Create, save, and replay your own Furby “dances.”

📝 Packet Inspector – Live logging of raw BLE data in HEX/ASCII.

🧩 Field Mapping – Assign BLE byte ranges to Furby states (Hunger, Mood, Battery, etc).
